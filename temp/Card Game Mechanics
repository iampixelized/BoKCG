Getting Started
Since this is a card game, the best place to start is with the actual cards. Download the starter project which provides a SpriteKit project preset for an iPad in landscape mode, as well as all the images, fonts and sound files you’ll need to create a functional sample game.
Take a minute to look around the project to acquaint yourself with its file structure and content. You should see the following project folders:
System: Contains the basic files to set up a SpriteKit project. This includes AppDelegate.swift, GameViewController.swift, and Main.storyboard
Scenes: Contains an empty main scene GameScene.swift which will manage the game content.
Card: Contains an empty Card.swift file which will manage the playing cards.
Supporting Files: Contains all the images, fonts, and sound files you’ll use in the tutorial.
This game just wouldn’t be as cool without the art, so I’d like to give special thanks to Vicki from gameartguppy.com for the beautiful card artwork!
A Classy Start
Since you can’t play a card game without cards, start by making a class to represent them. Card.swift is currently a blank Swift file, so find it and add:
import Foundation
import SpriteKit
 
class Card : SKSpriteNode {
 
  required init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder!) {
    fatalError("NSCoding not supported")
  }
 
  init(imageNamed: String) {
    let cardTexture = SKTexture(imageNamed: imageNamed)
    super.init(texture: cardTexture, color: nil, size: cardTexture.size())
  }
}
You’re declaring Card as a subclass of SKSpriteNode.
To create a simple sprite with an image, you would use SKSpriteNode(imageNamed:). In order to keep this behavior, you use the inherited initializer which must call the super classes designated initializer init(texture:color:size:). You do not support NSCoding in this game.
To put sprites on the screen, open GameScene.swift and add the following code to didMoveToView():
let wolf = Card(imageNamed: "card_creature_wolf.png")
wolf.position = CGPointMake(100,200)
addChild(wolf)
 
let bear = Card(imageNamed: "card_creature_bear.png")
bear.position = CGPointMake(300, 200)
addChild(bear)
