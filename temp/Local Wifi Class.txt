package
android.net.wifi
Provides classes to manage Wi-Fi functionality on the device.
The Wi-Fi APIs provide a means by which applications can communicate with the lower-level wireless stack that provides Wi-Fi network access. Almost all information from the device supplicant is available, including the connected network's link speed, IP address, negotiation state, and more, plus information about other networks that are available. Some other API features include the ability to scan, add, save, terminate and initiate Wi-Fi connections.
Some APIs may require the following user permissions:
•	ACCESS_WIFI_STATE
•	CHANGE_WIFI_STATE
•	CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE
Note: Not all Android-powered devices provide Wi-Fi functionality. If your application uses Wi-Fi, declare so with a <uses-feature> element in the manifest file:
<manifest ...>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.wifi" />
    ...
</manifest>
